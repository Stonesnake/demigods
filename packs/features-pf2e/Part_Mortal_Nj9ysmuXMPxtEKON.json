      "value": "<p>You are part mortal and part deity, and you might have been originally born fully mortal. Choose a mortal ancestry. Your size matches the mortal ancestry's size. In addition to your demigod trait, you gain the traits matching the chosen mortal ancestry. You start with the same languages as members of that ancestry, and your available bonus languages are the same as that ancestry, including an additional bonus language if that ancestry normally grants one (such as human). You still aren't quite a member of your mortal ancestry even if you were born as one, and so you can't take feats for members of that ancestry unless you first take the @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-demigods.feats-pf2e.Item.fShxYAF6o5eL5iQl]{Mortal Roots} feat.</p>",
