      "value": "<p>You've gained a third (or possibly fourth) spell that matches your religion which the true saints and hierophants of your faith can learn and you can cast on your own each day. Choose a 6th-rank or 7thrank spell from any spell list; most demigods choose a spell that isn't on the divine list because it helps their clerics more to do so, but you can choose a spell from the divine list if you prefer, despite your clerics' objections. You can cast this spell once per day as a divine innate spell; if you chose a 6th-rank spell with a duration of no more than 1 minute, you can instead cast it once per hour as a divine innate spell. Your clerics can prepare this spell and cast it as a divine spell, even if it isn't on the divine spell list.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> Most demigods don't gain both this feat and @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-demigods.feats-pf2e.Item.7G3CFjVXSRSj7K1L]{Divine Emissary Spell}. If you have both, you might be transitioning toward becoming a deity of magic who grants an especially large number of deity spells.</p>",
