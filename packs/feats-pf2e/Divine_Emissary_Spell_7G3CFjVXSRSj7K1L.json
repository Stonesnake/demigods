      "value": "<p>You've gained a third spell that matches your religion which your most faithful clerics can learn and you can cast on your own each day. Choose a 4th-rank or 5th-rank spell from any spell list; most demigods choose a spell that isn't on the divine list because it helps their clerics more to do so, but you can choose a spell from the divine list if you prefer, despite your clerics' protests. You can cast this spell once per day as a divine innate spell; if you chose a 4th-rank spell with a duration of no more than 1 minute, you can instead cast it once per hour as a divine innate spell. Your clerics can prepare this spell and cast it as a divine spell, even if it isn't on the divine spell list.</p>",
