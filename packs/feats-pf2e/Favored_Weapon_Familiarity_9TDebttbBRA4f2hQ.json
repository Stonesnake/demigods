If your favored weapon is an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purpose of proficiency. If your favored weapon is a martial weapon, you treat it as a simple weapon for the purpose of proficiency. If your favored weapon is a simple weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step. If your favored weapon is an unarmed attack with a damage die lower than a d6 (such as a fist), increase it by one.</p>",
