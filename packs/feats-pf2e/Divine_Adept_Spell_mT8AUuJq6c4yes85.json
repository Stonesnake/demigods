      "value": "<p>You've gained another special spell that matches your religion which your experienced clerics can learn and you can cast on your own each day. Choose a 2nd-rank or 3rd-rank spell from any spell list; most demigods choose a spell that isn't on the divine list because it helps their clerics more to do so, but you can choose a spell from the divine list if you prefer, despite your clerics' glares. You can cast this spell once per day as a divine innate spell; if you chose a 2nd-rank spell with a duration of no more than 1 minute, you can instead cast it once per hour as a divine innate spell. Your clerics can prepare this spell and cast it as a divine spell, even if it isn't on the divine spell list.</p>",
