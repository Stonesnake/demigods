Each time you finish a Long Rest, choose one cantrip from the Cleric spell list. You learn that cantrip until you use this trait again. Your spellcasting ability for the spell, as well as for any spell you gain from a demigod species feat, is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose the ability when you select this species).</p>",
