      "value": "<p>Trickery is the virtue of wily clever demigods with schemes and plans to get them out of any scrape or handle any situation. Trickery might not seem like a virtue to everyone, but trickster deities and demigods are often also those who use their schemes to defeat otherwise insurmountable threats or bring benefit to mortalkind, rather than just to enrich themselves and harm their foes.</p><p><strong>Real-World Examples:</strong> Examples of deities and demigods demonstrating trickery include Loki tricking Hodr into killing Balder with mistletoe, Prometheus stealing fire as a gift for mortalkind, as well as various other tricksters (including Ananse, Maui, and Raven) stealing or capturing celestial bodies like the sun, the moon, and the stars.</p><p><strong>Associated Skills:</strong> Acrobatics, Deception, Stealth</p><p><strong>Associated Domain:</strong> Trickery</p>",
