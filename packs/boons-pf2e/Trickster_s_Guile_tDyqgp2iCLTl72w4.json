      "value": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your turn ends</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are currently affected by a mental effect</p><hr /><p>Those who seek to bargain with or control you quickly learn that a trickster has slippery schemes and cunning ruses to elude the most carefully crafted wording or mental command. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect. You can suppress a particular effect using Trickster's Guile only once. You can't use Trickster's Guile to suppress an effect if you chose to have it affect you.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> Your divinity allows you to use Trickster's Guile even if the mental effect is preventing you from using reactions (such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix] condition) or controlling you to use your reactions in a certain way.</p>",
