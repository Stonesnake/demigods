Each day during your daily preparations, you can choose a 1st or 2nd level class feat for which you qualify and gain that class feat until your next daily preparations. If the feat has a usage of less than once per day, you can't use the feat unless you choose it for a number of days in a row equal to its frequency (for instance, if the feat was usable once per week, you'd need to select it seven times in a row before you could use it).</p>",
