Once per minute, you can use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.R9xqCBblkS5KE4y7] as a divine innate spell though only to contact one of your worshipers; once per hour, when you do, you can instead send a telepathic demand to your worshiper. You can contact your worshipers using Deity's Demand even if they're on a different planet or even a different plane, and you don't need to have been in telepathic contact with them before to issue a telepathic demandâ€”your bond as deity and follower more than suffices.</p>",
