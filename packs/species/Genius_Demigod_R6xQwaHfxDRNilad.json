      "value": "<p><em>The least of lesser deities, demigods are fledglings who must grow into their divine abilities before they can enact the kind of miracles associated with even the least of true gods. And yet, they can grow their faith and their power to become something more.</em></p><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-demigods.journals-dnd5e.JournalEntry.CqQoQpvqEOehOwgL.JournalEntryPage.ITImTyYjZ91IQtQx]{Demigod Ancestry}</p><p>Your brilliance, imagination, and ingenuity caused you to be labeled a genius, possibly even before you gained your divinity. You overflow with the virtue of innovation. You have the following benefits.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>: Special (see Part Mortal trait)</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: Special (see Part Mortal trait)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Special (see Part Mortal trait)</p><p>As a Demigod, you have these special traits.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Fatal Flaw.</strong> While you have some amount of divinity, and the combination of divine and mortal grants you great power and potential, you also possess a Fatal Flaw. Your Fatal Flaw is your choice of Hesitation, Hubris, or Vulnerability.</p><ul><li><strong>Hesitation</strong>. Whether it's the competing nature of divine and mortal or the sheer number of possibilities you can see throughout the Multiverse, you sometimes hesitate to make decisions quickly, and your body and mind sometimes act at different speeds, hindering your physical coordination. You can never gain Advantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li><li><strong>Hubris</strong>. As a demigod, you are more than a mere mortal, and your divinity allows you to gain worshipers, build up a religion, and even grant spells. You're amazing! Unfortunately, your pride sometimes causes you to make dangerous mistakes, though fortunately, your power might be enough to get you out of them. You can never gain Advantage on Wisdom saving throws.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>. While you possess the limitless potential of the immortal, ultimately your mortality mixes in a fatal vulnerability that portends your undoing someday. Whether that's a certain spot on your body that's more vulnerable or a particular substance that can slay you, the end result is that you're just a little less sturdy. You can never gain Advantage on Constitution saving throws.</li></ul><p><strong>Part Mortal.</strong> You are part mortal and part deity, and you might have been originally born fully mortal. Choose a mortal species. Your Creature Type, Size, and Speed are the same as the species you choose. However, you still aren't quite a member of your mortal species, even if you were born as one. You don't gain any of the other traits of that species, and you can't select feats that have your mortal species as a prerequisite, unless you first take the @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-demigods.feat-dnd5e.Item.6wOEUZ5mQM4bxhOD]{Mortal Roots} demigod species feat.</p><p><strong>Quasi Divine.</strong> You might not be a full deity, but you're still a demigod, so you have a bit of divinity that grows stronger as you do and increases as faith in you swells. Each time you finish a Long Rest, choose one cantrip from the Cleric spell list. You learn that cantrip until you use this trait again. Your spellcasting ability for the spell, as well as for any spell you gain from a demigod species feat, is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose the ability when you select this species).</p><p><strong>Genius.</strong> Due to your genius, you know just about all the basics of any topic you bother to study. When you would make an ability check to recall knowledge using a skill in which you have proficiency, you can choose to make the check with Advantage. If you do, you can't use Genius again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p><p><strong>Skill Training.</strong> You have proficiency in your choice of the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill, or with one tool of your choice.</p><hr /><p><em>Note: The base ancestry defaults selected for this Species are set to the Human species.</em></p>",
