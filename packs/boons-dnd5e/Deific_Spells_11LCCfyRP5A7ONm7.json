      "value": "<p>You obtain three spells that match your religion's theme, learning to cast them yourself and granting them to your clerics as well. Choose three 5th-level or lower spells from any spell list. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. You can choose to replace any Domain spell granted to your clerics with one of the spells from this boon, provided the new spell is of the same level or lower.</p>",
