      "value": "<p>You maintain a divine realm in a pocket dimension, and though it might not be impressive compared to the realms of true deities, it's plenty magnificent by mortal standards. You can spend 1 minute to conjure a 5-by-10-foot doorway to your divine realm, which remains in its current location until you conjure another. Only you and other creatures you invite to your divine realm can enter through the doorway, though it's possible for other creatures to trespass using means such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift}</em> spell. Your divine realm typically has a length and width equal to 10 times your Renown Score with your religion, and a height equal to 5 times your Renown Score, though you can work with your GM if you prefer a divine realm with a different shape but a roughly similar area (such as a giant tree that's taller but smaller in other dimensions). You determine the furnishings of your divine realm, though they exist only in your divine realm and can't be taken elsewhere or sold. Your divine realm has a number of spiritual servants up to half your Renown Score, rounded down; their appearance is up to you, but they can only perform simple tasks that would be possible for an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv]{Unseen Servant}</em> spell, regardless of how they look. If you wish it to, your divine realm produces enough food and drink to sustain a number of creatures equal to 5 times your Renown Score with luxurious and delicious meals each day.</p>",
