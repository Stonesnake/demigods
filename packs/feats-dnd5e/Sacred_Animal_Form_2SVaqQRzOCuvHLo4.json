      "value": "<p>You can take on a specific form matching your sacred animal as a peaceful emissary. Your animal form is specific and unique, and you must change into the same form each time. Your animal form has a supernatural clue, usually minor, indicating that it's special or related to your faith, such as a small religious symbol appearing on the fur, scales, or feathers, or a sparkle in the light.</p><p>When you select this feat, choose a Tiny Beast that represents your sacred animal, such as a Cat, Lizard, or Rat. The beast you choose must be CR 1 or less. You can use the Magic action to polymorph into your chosen beast, or back into your true form. If your chosen beast would normally have a Fly Speed, you can't use that Speed unless you are level 12 or higher.</p>",
