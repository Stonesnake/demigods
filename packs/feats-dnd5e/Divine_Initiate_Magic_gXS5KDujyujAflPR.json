You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p><p><strong>Customized Domain.</strong> You can choose to replace any Domain spell granted to your clerics with one of the spells from this feat, provided the new spell is of the same level or lower.</p>",
