      "value": "<p>Like other lesser deities, such as minor demon lords, empyreal lords, fey lords, and the like, you are able to revive yourself from death, but not without limit. When you die, as long as you have at least one worshiper, you can cause your body to vanish in an appropriate display for your religion's theme and domains (such as a flash of bright light), leaving behind your gear, allies, and killer. Since you're dead, your soul makes this decision, and in most cases you would choose to vanish, unless you expect an ally to revive you in short order.</p><p>If you choose to vanish, you migrate yourself into the soul of one of your worshipers. After [[/r 1d4 #days]]{1d4 days}, during which the worshiper must pray to you at least once per day, you appear at the end of their prayers, fully restored to health and wearing a simple outfit tied to your religious iconography. That worshiper can't ever revive you in this way again.</p><p>Once you use this feat to return from the dead, you can't do so again until 30 days have passed. If you die again during that time, you stay dead unless a different effect brings you back to life. Additionally, there is one specific and obscure way that you can be killed for good, such as by using mistletoe or striking a small part of your heel, in which case you can't use Limited Immortality even if you haven't used it within the last 30 days. You and your GM should work together to come up with this Achilles' heel; it should be something that would come up extremely rarely, unless someone specifically researched and discovered the secret.</p>",
